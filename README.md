### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for visiting my Github.

I'm Jaskirat Kaur, a [Computer Science/Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) grad student at the University of Chicago ðŸŽ“

- I am currently working as a Data Science Intern with [Invenergy](https://invenergy.com/) where I am improving the wind power forecasts using prediction intervals and tree based models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- I worked as an AI Research Assistant with [Center for Applied AI, Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence) where I built a pipeline for LLMs to interact with and assess the performance of AI Math Tutors. I also developed a Python package for an interactive [online baking assistant](http://cookies-ui.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/home).
- Passionate about education, I served as a Teaching Assistant for courses in Linear Algebra and Program Evaluation. You can find my work [here](https://github.com/jaskcodes/TAship-work).

- I have also worked with [deep_dive](https://dive.ai/) as a Data Scientist on their Financial sector and FMCG projects.
